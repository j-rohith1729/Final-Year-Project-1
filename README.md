# GAN-Based Data Augmentation for Flight Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting flight prices using a unique dataset collected through web scraping and augmented with synthetic data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By combining real-world data with advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to improve model accuracy and enable deeper insights into flight pricing trends.

## Data Collection
The dataset was curated by scraping the Google Flights website using the BeautifulSoup library in Python. Data was collected over 22 days, focusing on flights between Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad. For each day, flight schedules for the subsequent 28 days were recorded, resulting in a comprehensive dataset with features such as:
- Flight duration
- Ticket price
- Airline
- Departure and arrival times
- CO2 emissions
- Number of stops
- Days left until departure

## Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for analysis and modeling, several preprocessing steps were applied:
- **Handling Missing Values:** Imputation with median/mean values for numerical columns.
- **Feature Scaling:** Normalized numerical features using Min-Max scaling to ensure uniform contribution to the model.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features to avoid introducing false ordinal relationships.
- **Date-Time Feature Extraction:** Derived new features such as hour of the day and day of the week from datetime columns.
- **Feature Engineering:** Introduced the `days_left` column to indicate days remaining until departure.
- **Data Cleaning:** Corrected inconsistencies in column values, removed special characters, and eliminated redundant columns.

## GAN Architecture
The GAN architecture was tailored for tabular data generation. It includes two main components:

### Generator
- **Dense Layer 1:** 128 units with ReLU activation and `he_uniform` initializer.
- **Dense Layer 2:** 256 units with ReLU activation for learning complex patterns.
- **Output Layer:** Matches the dataset dimensions with a linear activation function.

### Discriminator
- **Dense Layer 1:** 256 units with ReLU activation and `he_uniform` initializer.
- **Dense Layer 2:** 128 units with ReLU activation for robust classification.
- **Output Layer:** Single unit with a sigmoid activation to classify data as real or fake.

The GAN was trained using an adversarial loop, iteratively updating the Generator and Discriminator to produce realistic synthetic data.

### Adaptations for Tabular Data
- Dense layers replaced convolutional layers for structured data.
- The Generator's output layer aligns with the dataset's features and scales.
- Preprocessing ensures effective learning from categorical and numerical data.

## Optimization Techniques
To ensure stable training and improved performance:
- **Gradient Clipping:** Prevents exploding gradients by capping updates to a threshold.
- **Min-Max Scaling:** Normalized features to a [0,1] range, ensuring equitable treatment.
- **Mini-batch Gradient Descent:** Enhanced training efficiency and generalization.

## Results
The GAN-generated synthetic data closely mimics the statistical properties of the original dataset, enhancing the training process and improving prediction accuracy. This project demonstrates the adaptability of GANs for structured tabular data and their potential to address data scarcity challenges in machine learning.

## Data Visualization
The dataset includes visualizations to illustrate trends in flight prices, durations, and other features. Example plots can be found in the `visualizations/` directory.
